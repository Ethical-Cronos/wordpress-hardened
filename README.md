Wordpress autoupdate container
==============================

Just another Wordpress + PHP + NGINX container, with addition of wp-cli running on each Saturday to perform CMS upgrade.
Use it like official Wordpress container, there are same configuration variables as same entrypoint is used as in original image.
The only difference is the installed and configured NGINX and scheduled CMS update.
